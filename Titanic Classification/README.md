# Titanic Classification
The Titanic Classification system is designed to predict whether the passenger has survived or not. The system takes into account few factors, such as socio-economic status, age and gender, to determine the likelihood of a person's safety in aquatic situations. By analyzing these factors, the system aims to provide valuable insights and assist in making informed decisions regarding safety measures.
## ML model used: XGBoost
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and popular machine learning algorithm known for its exceptional performance in various predictive modeling tasks, particularly in structured and tabular data. It is an implementation of the gradient boosting framework, which combines the predictions of multiple weak models (typically decision trees) to create a strong predictive model. Some characteristics of the XGBoost classifier are:
1. Gradient Boosting
2. Tree-Based Models
3. Regularization
4. Feature Importance
5. Handling Missing Values
6. Parallelization and Efficiency
7. Wide Range of Objective Functions
8. Tuning Parameters
