# Number Recognition System
The Handwritten Recognition System focuses on developing a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model to accurately classify and predict handwritten digit images. The project utilizes the widely-used MUIST dataset, which consists of a large collection of greyscaled images of handwritten digits (0-9).

# MNIST dataset
MNIST stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology. This dataset is widely-used a benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large collection of grayscaled images og handwritten digits. The dataset is commonly used for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly for image classification projects.
The key characteristics of this dataset are:-
1. __Size__:- It contains 70000 images in total, with 60000 images in the training set and 10000 images in the test set.
2. __Image Format__:- Each image is 28 x 28 pixel and greyscaled.
3. __Labels__:- The corresponding labels are digits from 0 to 9.
4. __Diversity__:- It includes a diverse range of handwritten styles, variations and quality, making it suitable benchmark for evaluating model's generalized capabilities.
5. __Standardization__:- This dataset has become a standard benchmark for image classification projects, often used as a baseline to compare the performance of different algorithms and models.

# CNN model
A Convolutional Neural Network is a deep learning model specifically designed for processing and analyzing structured grid-like data, such as images or sequences. CNNs are particularly powerful in computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

# Data preprocessing
## 1. One-hot encoding
It is a technique used to represent categorical variables numerically. It is commonly applied when dealing with classification problems in machine learning.
## 2. Data augmentaion
It is a technique used in data preprocessing to artificially increase the size and diversity of a training dataset. It involves applying a variety of transformations and modifications to the original data to create new and slightly modified versions of the existing samples. The main purpose of this technique is to enhance the model's ability to generalize and improve its performance by exposing it to a broader range of variations in the data.
