# Stock Prediction
The jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive guide that outlines the step-by-step process of model development, encompassing data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The notebook includes code snippets and visualization to facilitate understanding of the implementation details.

## Importance of predicting stock prices
1. Investment decision making
2. Risk management
3. Financial planning
4. Market Analysis
5. Trading strategies
6. Investor confidence
7. Economic impact

# Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
It is a kind of recurrent neural network system. These networks are designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs when processing long sequences of data by addressing the vanishing gradient problem.

# Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
It is widely used as an evaluation metric for regression models because it provides a clear and understandable measure of the model's accuracy. If the RMSE value is low, it indicates better predictiove performance, as they have few average errors between the predicted and actual values.
